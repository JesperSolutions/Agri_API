# GDPR Compliance Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the GDPR compliance measures implemented in the CO2 Calculation API to ensure the protection of personal data and user privacy.

## Data Collection and Processing

### Personal Data Collected
- User authentication information (username, hashed password)
- Company information for API token requests
- Contact email addresses
- Calculation history linked to user accounts

### Legal Basis for Processing
- Contract fulfillment (API service provision)
- Legitimate business interests (service improvement)
- User consent (explicitly obtained during registration)

### Data Minimization
1. Only essential data is collected
2. Simplified endpoints available that require minimal data
3. Personal data is separated from calculation data
4. Automatic data anonymization for analytics

## Technical Security Measures

### Data Encryption
- All personal data is encrypted at rest using AES-256
- Passwords are hashed using secure algorithms (PBKDF2)
- User IDs are hashed before storage in calculation records
- TLS/SSL encryption for all API communications

### Data Storage
1. Local Storage Security:
   - Database files are encrypted
   - Access controls implemented at OS level
   - Regular security audits
   - Automatic backup encryption

2. Database Security:
   - Prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
   - Row-level security policies
   - Regular security patches
   - Access logging and monitoring

### Access Controls
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Token-based authentication
- Regular access review
- Audit logging of all data access

## User Rights Implementation

### Right to Access
- Users can download their data via `/export` endpoint
- Complete calculation history available
- Data format choices (JSON, CSV)

### Right to Rectification
- Users can update their profile information
- Company information can be corrected
- Calculation metadata can be updated

### Right to Erasure
- Account deletion functionality
- Calculation history deletion
- Automatic data purging after retention period

### Right to Data Portability
- Data export in machine-readable formats
- Structured data format for easy transfer
- Complete calculation history export

## Data Retention

### Retention Periods
- User accounts: Active until deletion request
- Calculation history: 3 years
- Authentication logs: 1 year
- API access logs: 6 months

### Automatic Deletion
- Scheduled data purging jobs
- Immediate deletion on user request
- Secure deletion procedures

## Security Recommendations

### API Integration
1. Store API tokens securely
2. Implement token rotation
3. Use HTTPS for all communications
4. Implement rate limiting

### Local Storage
1. Encrypt the database file
2. Regular backups
3. Access control implementation
4. Secure deletion procedures

### Best Practices
1. Regular security updates
2. Access logging
3. Security audit procedures
4. Incident response plan
